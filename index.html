                            This is the first real game I made and published. It was made in Unity and I submitted it as
                            a project for my Computer Science (Informatica) class final workpiece in my last year of
                            high school.
                            It's a first person zombie wave shooter and I made it in collaboration with a friend who helped
                            mainly with the models. It taught me a lot about how important having proper leadership is,
                            because the friend who I worked with would slack a lot and I struggled making him stick to
                            our planned deadlines. So in the end I ended up doing 80-90% of the work.
                            Even though this put some stress on me, I still ended up with a nice product and it was
                            even almost submitted by our teacher to be one of the top workpieces that year.

                            This is the 2nd game I had officially published. It was right after my first one and it was
                            made as an application for BUAS. I however was focused on exams and studying so I didn't
                            make enough time for it. It was still a worthwhile experience and I learned a lot.
                            It was a 2d platformer with 3 levels, I made a story for it and some custom sprites.
                            It was also made in Unity and gave me some more experience working in code and on 2d games.

                         This was a project for my programming class at Hogeschool Rotterdam. We were tasked to use the
                         Excalibur engine which uses javascript to code games into your webpage. To complete this assigment
                         I decided to make a small little space shooter reminiscent of old arcade games.

                            Harvest Hofrizons was another school project that me and 3 friends made. For our assignment
                            we were tasked to make a game based on a random location give to us in Rotterdam and a random
                            player type and gameplay genre. We got Hofbogen, Killer player type and a submission game genre.
                            We ended up making a choose-your-own adventure farming game with a score. You'd farm up until
                            you have enough crops/money to buy one of the endings. It was made in Godot, I designed
                            the main gameplay loop of the game and all the endings. I also helped keep track of the project
                            to make sure all our deadlines were met.

                            Bum Life was my first game made in Unreal Engine. I made it with help of some friends, altho
                            I did most of the work as my friends were busy graduating university. I mainly used this project
                            to get a basic understanding of Unreal apart from all the smaller tests I had done before.
                            I also learnt how to edit the look of Unreal Engine to add a little style to the game.
                            It's a simple game about gaining as many points as you can by being a "bum". Making the game
                            also taught me how savegames work in Unreal.

                            My first real gamejam game! for GGJ2025 at BUAS. I got together a team by making a post
                            in the GGJ BUAS discord where some kind people reached out asking to join my team! Tuwi ((Nannings)Solo indie Dev),
                            Michel (BUAS VA Alumni), Kaizo (Hobby dev), Tural (Y3 BUAS D&P Student) and David (Y3 BUAS D&P Student). Those were
                            the people who made up my team. The theme was Bubbles and we decided to spin the theme on it's
                            head by making it about economic bubbles. In this project I designed the manual bubbles you can click and their
                            prompts. I also oversaw the deadlines and put every goal of ours into MoSCoW priority to make sure
                            we stayed on track. The game ended up being a sort of stock market idle game where random
                            events impact the market and how you interact with certain situation also impact the market.

                            I made this game for my intake assignment for BUAS! It's a simple 2D platformer made in Unreal
                            Engine. It's a sidecroller focused on speedrunning, abilities and climbing-based route finding.
                            I learnt a lot about tilemaps, character movement, Stopwatches, abilities and level design.

                            This isn't a system I have made yet, but I wrote it down. It's a system for a horror multiplayer
                            versus game. The premise is that two teams will go against each other, there are 2 phases. The
                            build phase where you setup your base with traps and scares and the loot phase where you go through
                            the enemies' base while a creature is chasing you (possibly controlled by a player). The team
                            to collect the most worth will win after 3 full rotations.

                            This system looks at your system time and if it goes past a certain time, it'll swap the game
                            from a cozy farming game, to a horror organ farming game. I haven't made this system yet, but
                            me and some friends are planning to make a game around it this summer.

                            The elementary school I went to was NBS Boeimeer in Breda. I skipped the first year which caused me

                            advanced maths classes when they were available. I ended up graduating with a HAVO/VWO advice.

                            I went to Mencia de Mendoza Lyceum in Breda. I studied at a HAVO TTO level meaning I got
                            bilingual courses and got the opportunity to go on multiple cultural trips. Sadly the
                            exchange that was planned got cancelled due to covid. I averaged a steady 7.5/10 throughout
                            my years and eventually went with a study-profile (Curriculum) of E&M (Economics and Social).
                            I graduated without issue and got a IGCSE Certificate for my bilingual and globalisation skills.

                            I went to Hogeschool Rotterdam for a year. Here I learnt about game design and web development.
                            I went to their Creative Media & Game Technologies course and made some good friends there.
                            After I got my propaedeutic certificate I ended up leaving and taking a gap year as the
                            school was focusing more on web development than game development and web development didn't
                            really interest me as much. Thankfully I did learn a lot in my year there, I got used to
                            working in groups and taking a lead/managerial position in group projects. I got familiar with
                            working for a client. Got a lot better at accessibility, diversity and inclusivity. And learnt
                            a lot about self study and game design.

                            I worked at Albert Heijn for 2 years and 2 months. I worked as a stocker at 2 locations,
                            Brabantplein and De Burcht. I learnt a lot about working under a boss, customer service,
                            working for a company and experience working together with coworkers.

                            I currently work at Bouwloket Breda, here I help my dad who works with the company do tasks
                            like: Managing files, managing databases, helping fill out buildplans, sketching dormers,
                            lining out property boundaries and sketching/blueprinting old and future versions of houses.
                            These experiences have helped me think critically and professionally, plan ahead and
                            work in a serious place of business in an office.
