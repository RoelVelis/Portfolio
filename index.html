                        <p>
                            This is the first real game I made and published. It was made in Unity and I submitted it as
                            a project for my Computer Science (Informatica) class final workpiece in my last year of
                            high school.
                            It's a first person zombie wave shooter and I made it in collaboration with a friend who helped
                            mainly with the models. It taught me a lot about how important having proper leadership is,
                            because the friend who I worked with would slack a lot and I struggled making him stick to
                            our planned deadlines. So in the end I ended up doing 80-90% of the work.
                            Even though this put some stress on me, I still ended up with a nice product and it was
                            even almost submitted by our teacher to be one of the top workpieces that year.

                        <p>
                            This is the 2nd game I had officially published. It was right after my first one and it was
                            made as an application for BUAS. I however was focused on exams and studying so I didn't
                            make enough time for it. It was still a worthwhile experience and I learned a lot.
                            It was a 2d platformer with 3 levels, I made a story for it and some custom sprites.
                            It was also made in Unity and gave me some more experience working in code and on 2d games.

                            The elementary school I went to was NBS Boeimeer in Breda. I skipped the first year which caused me
                            to be among the youngest in my classes going forth. I didn't get held back and even took some
                            advanced maths classes when they were available. I ended up graduating with a HAVO/VWO advice.

                            I went to Mencia de Mendoza Lyceum in Breda. I studied at a HAVO TTO level meaning I got
                            bilingual courses and got the opportunity to go on multiple cultural trips. Sadly the
                            exchange that was planned got cancelled due to covid. I averaged a steady 7.5/10 throughout
                            my years and eventually went with a study-profile (Curriculum) of E&M (Economics and Social).
                            I graduated without issue and got a IGCSE Certificate for my bilingual and globalisation skills.

                            I went to Hogeschool Rotterdam for a year. Here I learnt about game design and web development.
                            I went to their Creative Media & Game Technologies course and made some good friends there.
                            After I got my propaedeutic certificate I ended up leaving and taking a gap year as the
                            school was focusing more on web development than game development and web development didn't
                            really interest me as much. Thankfully I did learn a lot in my year there, I got used to
                            working in groups and taking a lead/managerial position in group projects. I got familiar with
                            working for a client. Got a lot better at accessibility, diversity and inclusivity. And learnt
                            a lot about self study and game design.

                            I currently work at Bouwloket Breda, here I help my dad who works with the company do tasks
                            like: Managing files, managing databases, helping fill out buildplans, sketching dormers,
                            lining out property boundaries and sketching/blueprinting old and future versions of houses.
                            These experiences have helped me think critically and professionally, plan ahead and
                            work in a serious place of business in an office.
